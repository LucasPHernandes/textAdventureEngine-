# Text game Engine?

Just a tiny project trying to create a _"game engine"_ to make text based games (as the old times).
The code isn't very organized yet 'cause I started this project the wrongest way possible, trying to make the game and the engine at the same time.

To be fair I don't know if I actually can say that thi is a engine or anything like that, it's just a simple project (I hoep...).
